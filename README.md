# CodeLou_FrontEnd

## Description

My project was to build a new website for a local filmmaker, Kay Milam. Her new film is a feature documentary about the Monarch Butterfly.


## Custom CSS Classes

The class(es) I created are:

1. .topnav

Formats main navigation to display as flex in a row, remain at the top of the page, and have a transparent background.

2. .hero

Inserts the background image on the homepage and formats it to extend the full width of the display, and well beyond the height so it is scrollable. It's in a flex display with content center aligned.


## Custom JavaScript Functions

The javascript functions I created are:

1. function myFunction()
It toggles between adding or removing the "responsive" class to .topnav when user clicks on the hamburger icon.
