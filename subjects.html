      Lincoln’s passion for monarchs began when he was a graduate student at Yale in the 1950s. Known for his work on monarch butterflies through six decades, he is considered one of, if not the world’s foremost expert on monarch butterflies. His research interests included the overwintering and migration biology of the monarch butterfly, chemical defense, ecological chemistry, mimicry, scientific filmmaking, and the conservation of endangered biological phenomena and ecosystems. Professor Brower authored and co-authored more than 200 scientific papers, eight films, and edited two books. He was a recipient of the Wilbur Cross Medal from Yale University, the Medal for Zoology from the Linnean Society of London, a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Animal Behavior Society, and the Henry Bates Award for the Biology and Conservation of Tropical Butterflies. In June, 2007, he received the Royal Entomological Society of London Marsh Award for “Lifetime contributions to Insect Conservation” and “Outstanding Contribution to the Field of Entomology”, and in November 2008, he was especially honored to receive the Mexican Federal Government’s award: Reconocimiento a la Conservacion de la Naturaleza. In 2016, he received the E.O. Wilson Award for his work to preserve the monarch from the Center for Biological Diversity. He served as Presidents of the Society for the Study of Evolution, the International Society of Chemical Ecology and the Lepidopterists’ Society. He collaborated with various groups to protect and restore overwintering forests of the monarch butterfly in Mexico. His conservation interests in the USA also included modern agriculture’s severe impact on biodiversity.

      Unfortunately Lincoln passed away at his Virginia home in 2018 just prior to the completion of the finished film, but he will always be remembered for doing more for the monarchs and their overwintering habitat in Mexico than perhaps any one human has to this point. Director Kay Milam issues the question and challenge asking “who will now pick up the torch and lead the charge?”

        Bill Calvert is a legend in the monarch world and often referred to as a “cowboy entomologist.” From childhood he was obsessed with monarch butterflies and devoted his life to unraveling their magic and mysteries.  Bill received a degree in philosophy from the University of Texas and then went off to serve in Uncle Sam's Army. After two years of soldiering, he decided he was a very poor soldier, and that he needed to do something practical. So he took up the study of butterflies. For his dissertation project he researched butterfly feet. More specifically, he investigated the mechanism by which female butterflies located their host plants. After a varied career in many places and involving many insect types, he began a collaboration with Lincoln P. Brower, one of the world's experts on the monarch butterfly, which produced over thirty scientific papers on the monarch. For a time, Bill led eco-cultural tours to the monarch over-wintering areas in Mexico. Bill has now retired from leading tours and has found a new way of life as a lamp maker in Otter Creek, Maine. The general term for his lamps is “Steampunk”, meaning that they are basically found objects construed and fastened together in odd, artistic ways.

        When Carol was only three she shinnied up a cottonwood tree to get on top of the chicken shed because she wanted to see what the world looked like from there. She wanted to know things, find the answer, solve the riddle, and find out why. Today she still feels that the greatest gift given to her by her parents was an insatiable sense of curiosity.  She grew up on a small farm right on the Texas border up in the Panhandle. She played outdoors from dawn to dusk and only went inside when the weather was bad and recalls countless hours observing the red ant bed in the front yard. She wishes that every child could know the tranquility and impetus to imagination that an hour of watching a red ant colony can bring. And too that every child could experience that sense of wonder just waiting for them in a pond full of tadpoles or in the hatching of a chick, the emergence of a monarch butterfly from its chrysalis, or the interconnectedness of the seasons and the migrations of the birds and insects through the stark, but beautiful land of South Texas. Carol taught high school art for 18 years, and also Earth Science for another two years. Although now retired, Carol continues her educational outreach to the children and youth near her home of Eagle Pass and is an active citizen scientist continuing to participate annually in the eastern monarch butterfly migration.
