<!-- Start paragraph description of film. -->

    <p>The Fall migration of the monarch butterfly has been described as one of the truly greatest phenomenons of the natural world. Millions of these fragile creatures travel up to 2,500 miles to reach their overwintering grounds in the rare oyamel fir forests of the Transvolcanic Mountain Range of Central Mexico.
      </br></br>
    Currently in post-production, The Butterfly Trees is a one-hour documentary film being produced for public television and non-theatrical distribution. This inspiring film will tell the amazing story and heroic journey of the monarch butterflies and their imperiled overwintering grounds.
      </br></br>
    The Butterfly Trees captures the beauty and mystery of this great butterfly gathering and brings sharp focus to the complexities of modern threats to its habitat, and thus to the very existence of this endangered migratory phenomenon.</p>
