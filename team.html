              At the heart of her photographic passion, Theresa is a master of creating imagery in the spirit of playfulness, intimacy and connection. As a child, she stargazed from the rear dash of her dad's Chrysler, then began chasing sunsets once she first learned to drive. Most days, Theresa can be found immersed in the wild natural world with camera in hand, photographing Texas wildflowers, migrating monarchs, or the golden light illuminating the mesas and mountains of the desert southwest.
              <br><br>
              As a self-taught freelance photographer and lover of music, Theresa has documented the Texas music scene for several decades shooting for various artists, record companies, SXSW, Texas Monthly and Rolling Stone. Recently she has also worked with Texas Highways Magazine & Texas Parks and Wildlife. Her current, ongoing exhibition, Delicate Balance: Metamorphosis of the Monarch Butterfly, premiered at the Cockerel Butterfly Center at the Museum of Natural Science then traveled to northern New Mexico's La Mesa Gallery in Los Alamos.
